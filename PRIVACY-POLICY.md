# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

SP engineering built the Frigate Viewer application as a Open Source Application. This App is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visibors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my App.

## Information Collection and Use

The App requires to provide your Frigate NVR server connection data. The data are stored in device internal memory and are not collected by me or any other third-party companies.

The App can store snapshots and clip from your Frigate NVR server in device internal memory. The files are never transferred outside your device.

## Service Providers

The App uses Frigate NVR server API to show the content. According to my best knowledge the server does not collect any data about connected devices. However Frigate NVR is third party software, its source code may be modified or forked, and I suggest to follow Privacy Policy of used server and software.

## Security

This App is intended to connect to Frigate NVR server of your choice. Remember that security of your data depends on security of your device (data is stored internally) and your server (the app uses server through network connection). Make sure that your device is secure and make sure that you use safe connection to connect to reliable Frigate NVR server. I cannot guarantee its absolute security, because it depends mostly on you.

## Links to Other Sites

The app may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites.

## Children's Privacy

The app is not indended for anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to take necessary actions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
